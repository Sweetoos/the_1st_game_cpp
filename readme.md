# Game

This is a project to just write a code and get experience in writing code. 
I dunno what ideas will cross my mind in this project and what will be a final form of this project

To build I use CMake as my build system generator and Ninja as my build system

Commands:
```
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja

ninja -C build

build/run
```
# TODO

- Setters and Getters
- Every entity should have name and id
- Add more races to the game
- Add physical weapons
- Add magical weapons
- Add armoury
